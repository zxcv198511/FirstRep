How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Difference between two files showed typos and code changes due to changes in fumctionality. It was easier and more time efficinet to find errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will allow me to: 
	1) easily get back to previous versions of the code
	2) find bugs quicker

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

        Pros:
	* programmer's logic in version
	* saved code can be tested, documented
	* confidence to make changes
	Cons:
	* less safe - programmer can forget to make a commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git system is targerted for IT professional, whose projects can consist of numerous files (code, layouts, resoutces) whereas googledocs is version control for general use

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log Shows the commit logs
    got diff shows differences in code between two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
